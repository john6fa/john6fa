I am an aspiring full-stack software engineer with a passion for healthcare, technology, and business. I love the creative problem-solving process and the design and implementation of effective and efficient code.

As a learner who is detail-oriented and self-motivated, my passion stems from the ability to improve efficiency in countless operations and most importantly, develop better practices for controlling the safety and efficacy of life-changing technology.

Likewise, I treat mentorship with the same mentality. I am grateful for the mentors who have helped me tremendously in every stage of my life. I aim to do the same by becoming a mentor and cohesively lifting those around me, as personally, the feeling of this process is extremely gratifying.
